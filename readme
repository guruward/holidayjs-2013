Holiday_JS 2013 Hackathon

This is a MEAN Stack application. This hack was to create a christmas themed app.
The application allows the user to enter a search string for a song or artiist.

It uses the spotify api to bring back a JSON list albums. 

Angular ng-repeat is used to display the titles for a user to choose the album to be played.
